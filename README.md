## Description

Script to help color-code the left, middle, and right controls of a rig. Instead of manually going into every control to change their shape's color, this code takes the average naming conventions (L_*_CON, R_*_CON, *_CON) for rigging and uses them to enable overrides and assign a color to controls based on their assigned position! You will also get a fun message indicating the coloring is being done.

The main project file can be copy-pasted out into a Python tab in Maya's script editor. After executing, it will color your controls by typical rig standards (red, blue, and yellow). You could include this in a more extensive rigging script, but for controls already applied this can help avoid entering the attribute editor at all.
